 This is a react js web application. It's kind of a dashboard . It gives everyday’s covid reports which include the number of cases , number of people recovered and number of deaths . This information is given for all countries and worldwide. Three graphs of worldwide data are made using chart js-2 library . I have deployed and hosted in firebase

# What technology are used to build this?
In this project I have used react js ,html , css & chart-js-2 to build line graphs. <br/>
I have used material ui icons in the project for the icons . <br/>
We will be getting the data related to covid from disease.sh . <br/>

# How I build it ?

Here in App.js, I am fetching the data related to covid from **disease.sh**(link below) at first then storing it and then passing it through various components.
After that I developed each component like the graph components and the infobox component to display the countries and respective cases. 
I used FormControl and MenuItem (Material ui components) to design and develop the boxes which shows live cases at the top . You can select a particular country or check worldwide data there. <br/>
The graph shows details about worldwide cases , recoved cases and death cases .
